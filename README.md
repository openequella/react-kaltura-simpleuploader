A basic library to make it easy to add support for uploading single videos to Kaltura.

## Licensing

The Kaltura libraries seem to mainly be [AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)
which is at odds with the [Apereo Practices on Third-Party
Licenses](https://www.apereo.org/licensing/third-party). Hence, this module is kept stand-alone.
